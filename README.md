# Investigate a Dataset Project

This is a project for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. It explores a dataset from Kaggle for doctors visits in Brazil. The focus on this project is exploring what factors can affect the chances of a patient making or missing their appointment, focusing on the three independent variables of patient age, patient disability status, and whether the patient has received a text message reminder for the appointment. 

## Prerequisites

This code depends on the following libraries:<br>
1.`datetime`<br>
2.`numpy`<br>
3.`pandas`<br>
4.`matplotlib.pyplot`<br>
5.`seaborn`<br>

In addition to these, the Jupyter Notebook assumes that the Kaggle data has been downloaded, extracted, and saved as 'noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv'.
