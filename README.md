# Investigate a Dataset Project

This is a project for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. It explores a dataset from Kaggle for doctors visits in Brazil. The focus on this project is exploring what factors can affect the chances of a patient making or missing their appointment, focusing on the three independent variables of patient age, patient disability status, and whether the patient has received a text message reminder for the appointment.
